# <Insert name here>

The goal of this project is to be able to symbolically execute binaries
using the `isla` project and then prove (as) automatically (as possible)
that two different optimisation levels have the exact same behavior.
This is done by using intensively DWARF debugging information, in particular
C type information. The project will only work for binaries generated from C.

## Dependencies

You need a specific `linksem` commit installed (See LINKSEM_COMMIT var in Makefile).
The simplest way is to check it out and then pin it with opam (`opam install .`)

You also need to install `isla` and `isla-lang` from the `read-dwarf` branch.
`make install` will work in both, but isla-lang can also be install via `opam`
with `opam install .`
Warning for non-Rust users: You need to add ~/.cargo/bin to your PATH
or specify the position of `isla-client` in `ISLA_CLIENT_PATH`

Finally you need `cmdliner`, `pprint`, `res` and `ocamlgraph` from opam:

`opam install cmdliner pprint res ocamlgraph`

## Configuration

There is no configure script. To edit the compile time configuration, 
copy `default_config.ml` into `config.ml` and edit the variables you wish
to change from the default. If `config.ml` is not found, the build system
will use `default_config.ml` instead.

In particular you can change the supported architecture for the build by editing 
the `module Arch` variable to point to the module you want in `src/archs`.

## Building

A simple `make` works. `read-dwarf` symlink will then be created.

## Installing

To install `read-dwarf`, you can do `dune install` without opam or
just use opam and do `opam install .`.

`dune uninstall` also work.

## Auto-formatting

To have auto-formatting you need exactly version 0.12 of `ocamlformat`.
For example one could do:

`opam pin ocamlformat 0.12` and `opam install ocamlformat`.

Then you can use `make format` to format your code.
Please always format before committing.
Ask everyone if you want to change ocamlformat options or bump the version.


## Documentation

`make doc` builds the documentation that is then accessible from `doc.html`.

## Usage

You can run `./read-dwarf --help` to get the list of subcommand. For each
subcommand you can run `./read-dwarf subcommand --help` to learn more about
the subcommand

## Testing

You can run `make test` for self testing.

## Folder structure

 - `src`: The OCaml sources
   - `dune`: The dune configuration file
   - `.merlin`: Auto generated merlin file, do not commit.
   - `intro.smt2`: Common SMT definition used when calling a SMT solver.
     This is embedded in the binary.
   - `archs`: All the architecture specific code. Chose one in `config.ml`
 - `default_config.ml`: Default configuration
 - `config.ml`: Current configuration (may be omitted to use `default_config.ml`
 - `dune-project`: Global dune configuration
 - `dune`: Some other dune configuration for the `config.ml` file
 - `read-dwarf.opam`: OPAM file. Generated by `dune-project`, edit `dune-project`.
 - `notes`: Various notes and thought about the project development.
 - `TODO.md`: The current TODO list.
 - `hafnium*/*`: Each folder is a specific hafnium build to test on.
   The binaries are frozen and should not be changed.
 - `compare-O0-O2`: Folder for graphs comparing `O0` and `O2` hafnium builds.
 - `test_asm`: Simple assembly test to test `run-bb` subcommand.
 - `tiny_test`: Simple C tests, see the corresponding README inside the folder.
 - `mpool`: Folder to build some mpool specific tests
 - `emacs-highlighting`: Emacs coloring for read-dwarf rd output.
   Add the beginning of such file and follow the instructions.

## Caching

Read-dwarf may create a cache in a directory named `.rdcache`. When searching for a cache,
read-dwarf will search if there already is a `.rdcache` directory either in the current
directory or one of its parent and use the closest one it find. If it finds none and need
a cache, it will create a .rdcache in the current directory. This directory contains several
caches indexed by name.

Use `read-dwarf clear-cache name` to delete such a cache or
`read-dwarf clear-cache -a` to clear the whole `.rdcache` directory.
