# <Insert name here>

The goal of this project is to be able to symbolically execute binaries
using the `isla` project and then prove (as) automatically (as possible)
that two different optimisation levels have the exact same behavior.
This is done by using intensively DWARF debugging information, in particular
C type information. The project will only work for binaries generated from C.

## Dependencies

### Build dependencies
There is one dependency that is not on opam: `isla-lang`. Go to [the `isla-lang`
repository](https://github.com/rems-project/isla-lang) and install the latest
version. `opam install .` should work there.

Then you can either install the default configuration of read-dwarf with opam,
with `opam install .` or just install other dependencies with
`opam install --deps-only .` and then follow the rest of the README


### Run time dependencies

You need a more or less recent version `z3`, if don't have it on your system
package manager, you can use `opam install z3`.

You also need to install `isla` from `cargo` with `cargo install isla --version
0.1.0`. The current target version is `0.1.0`. Any other version is untested and
given that `isla` is still in development, is not expected to work. Warning for
non-Rust users: You need to add `~/.cargo/bin` to your PATH or specify the
position of `isla-client` in `ISLA_CLIENT_PATH` for `read-dwarf` to find it.

## Configuration

There is no configure script. To edit the compile time configuration,
copy `default_config.ml` into `config.ml` and edit the variables you wish
to change from the default. If `config.ml` is not found, the build system
will use `default_config.ml` instead.

In particular you can change the supported architecture for the build by editing
the `module Arch` variable to point to the module you want in `src/archs`.

The run time configuration is in `config.toml`, but for now during development
it is checked out in the repository.

## Building

A simple `make` works. A `read-dwarf` symlink will then be created.

While developing, `make merlin` will only build the necessary parts for the
merlin plugin to work. It will fail later than plain `make` allowing a more
accurate linting.

## Installing

To install `read-dwarf`, you can do `dune install` without opam or
just use opam and do `opam install .`.

`dune uninstall` also work.

## Auto-formatting

To have auto-formatting you need exactly version 0.12 of `ocamlformat`.
For example one could do:

`opam pin ocamlformat 0.12` and `opam install ocamlformat`.

Then you can use `make format` to format your code.
Please always format before committing.
Ask everyone if you want to change ocamlformat options or bump the version.


## Documentation

`make doc` builds the automatic documentation that is then accessible from
`doc.html`.

The `odoc` program (`opam install odoc`) is required.

Extra documents are available in the `doc` folder.

## Usage

You can run `./read-dwarf --help` to get the list of subcommand. For each
subcommand you can run `./read-dwarf subcommand --help` to learn more about
the subcommand

## Testing

You can run `make test` for self testing.
The libraries `ounit` and `qtest` are additionally required.
You can get then from opam:

```
opam install qtest ounit
```

## Folder structure

 - `src`: The OCaml sources
   - `dune`: The dune configuration file
   - `.merlin`: Auto generated merlin file, do not commit.
   - `intro.smt2`: Common SMT definition used when calling a SMT solver.
     This is embedded in the binary.
   - `archs`: All the architecture specific code. Chose one in `config.ml`.
   - `ast.ott`: The ott syntax of the internal language
 - `default_config.ml`: Default configuration
 - `config.ml`: Current configuration (may be omitted to use `default_config.ml`)
 - `dune-project`: Global dune configuration
 - `dune`: Some other dune configuration for the `config.ml` file
 - `read-dwarf.opam`: OPAM file. Generated by `dune-project`, edit `dune-project`.
 - `notes`: Various notes and thought about the project development.
 - `doc`: Documentation related element
 - `TODO.md`: The current TODO list.
 - `hafnium*/*`: Each folder is a specific hafnium build to test on.
   The binaries are frozen and should not be changed.
 - `compare-O0-O2`: Folder for graphs comparing `O0` and `O2` hafnium builds.
 - `test_asm`: Simple assembly test to test `run-bb` subcommand.
 - `tiny_test`: Simple C tests, see the corresponding README inside the folder.
 - `mpool`: Folder to build some mpool specific tests
 - `emacs-highlighting`: Emacs coloring for `read-dwarf rd` output.
   Add this snippet at the beginning of such outputs and follow the instructions.

## Caching

Read-dwarf may create a cache in a directory named `.rdcache`. When searching
for a cache, read-dwarf will search if there already is a `.rdcache` directory
either in the current directory or one of its parent and use the closest one it
finds. If it finds none and need a cache, it will create a .rdcache in the
current directory. This directory contains several caches indexed by name.

Use `read-dwarf cache --clear name` to delete such a cache or
`read-dwarf cache --clear --a` to clear the whole `.rdcache` directory.
You also do `read-dwarf cache --list` to list existing caches.
