{0 Command line interface}

[read-dwarf] as a various set of subcommand for testing various aspect of the
code. They are call like [read-dwarf subcommand --options ..]. The convention is
that for each subcommand there is a corresponding module. For example the
[run-func] subcommand is implemented in {!Run.Func}. All the command line
interface of read-dwarf use the [cmdliner] library.
Those module export a [command] value like {!Run.Func.command}.
This value is then used by [Main] to build and call the main command line.

To add a new subcommand, you have to make a new module, with the logic of that subcommand,
export a [command] value, and add that value in [Main].

{1 Common options}

There are a certain number of common options for setting binary paths or config
file locations from the command line. They are all defined in {!Config.CommonOpt}.
This module also contain common [cmdliner] infrastructure.

{1 Low-level isla testing}

This section is about command to test the isla interaction on single
instructions. All those subcommand start with [isla-*].

 - [isla-server] (in {!Isla.Server.Cmd}) allow to do manual call to the isla server.
   The input is un-parsed and transmitted as raw text to isla, however the result
   is parsed and printed again as the protocol is partially a binary protocol.

 - [isla-test] (in {!Isla.Test}) allow to test all the elements of the pipeline
     individually. In particular it allows to parse an isla trace text from disk
     and other similar low-level testing operation. It completely ignores the
     {!Isla.Cache}.

{1 Information dumping}

This section is about sub-commands that dump ELF and DWARF information without
doing any symbolic execution.

 - [rd] (in {!Run.ReadDwarf}) : Dumps an ELF file in the read-dwarf format. DWARF
     information is interleaved with the result of the objdump, so one can see
     how the dwarf information is positioned compared to the assembly. It will
     also try to read the source file to interleave the original source code. 
 - [dump-sym] (in {!Other_cmds.DumpSym}) : Dumps the ELF symbols as parsed by the {!Elf}
   modules.
 - [dump-dwarf] (in {!Other_cmds.DumpDwarf}) : Dumps the ELF information as parsed by the
   {!Dw} modules.

{1 Symbolic Execution}

This section is about sub-commands that test the symbolic execution engine. They
all start with [run-*].

 - [run-instr] (in {!Run.Instr}): Run a single instruction. Can also dump its
   {!Trace}.
 - [run-bb] (in {!Run.BB}): Run a basic block. This will run instructions in
   order, without updating the PC: Any jump will be ignored.
 - [run-block] (in {!Run.Block}): Run a complex block of instruction. One need to
   specify a start point and an end condition.
 - [run-func] (in {!Run.Func}): Same as [run-block] but start at function start
   and does proper function entry initialization according to the ABI.
 - [run-func-rd] (in {!Run.FuncRD}: Same as [run-func] but also interleave the
   [rd] output.

{1 Cache maintenance}

The [read-dwarf cache] sub-command (in {!Utils.Cache.cmd}) provides some cache
maintenance operations.
