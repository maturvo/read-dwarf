{0 Symbolic Execution}

This page decribe the general method for symbolically running code in [read-dwarf].

To run instructions on a state, you must first get the instruction semantics trough
the {{!Isla.Pipeline}Isla pipeline}. Then you can run trace individually using {!Trace.Run}
module or do it all automatically using the {!Run.Runner}.

To run entire block of instruction there is the legacy {!Run.BB} to run a branchless
and jumpless basic block and {!Run.Block} to run a complete block of code with
control-flow. {!Run.Block} will output a tree of the possibilities, but is still
quite basic. There is no need for fancier generic way of running block of
instruction as the actual order of running thing will be choosen by the
simulation finding code that is not yet written.
