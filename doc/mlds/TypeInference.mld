{0 Type Inference}

The type inference engine is a somewhat basic system right now. The types
themselves are defined in {!Ctype}, but the type inference engine is in
{!Trace.Typer}. This because the type inference is done instruction by
instruction over trace expressions, and not directly on state expression.
