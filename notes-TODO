Symbolic symbol table
- value of symbol?? (we don't have segments in relocatable files)
- can probably keep the same api, but addresses are symbolic

Instruction fetch: is it sound? (rewriting .text)

Z3 finding unique solution
- Get model -> assert not model -> check now it is unsat
- Need to extend the protocol probably

SIMREL
- state = (pc,M) (and registers TODO)
- (pc,M1) ~ (pc.M2) iff there is MT, such that
    MT(A1,A2,sz) = T => M1[A1:A1+sz] =T M2[A2:A2+sz]
    and respects dwarf at pc
    and maybe some consistency of MT?? e.g. overlaping ranges
- relation (=T) defined using MT
    - (=base_type) is equality
    - (=struct) fieldwise
    - (=*T):
        A1 =*T A2 <=> MT(A1,A2,sz(T)) = T
- Hoare logic (or similar) with MT as variable (only read/write commands)
